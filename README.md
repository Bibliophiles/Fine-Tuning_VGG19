### Description
This model uses [VGG19](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/VGG19) which is an already trained AI model on the
[Imagenet Dataset](https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php) as a base-model. It then trains the base-model - taking a number of layers - on the [CIFAR10 DATASET](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to make predictions on 10 classes.
